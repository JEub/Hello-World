# Hello-World
This is my "Introduction to GitHub" repository. 

I suppose that I should start by saying that I am the founder of Eubanks.Tech. Although it isn't actually an organization yet since it's only me, one day I hope to build it into an organization of people who generally either want to learn about certain aspects of "tech" or want to teach others about "tech". Yes, this does sound a lot like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>, but we will be different in that a) we will post actual lessons and b) we will answer questions with the intent on teaching you rather than just giving an answer.
